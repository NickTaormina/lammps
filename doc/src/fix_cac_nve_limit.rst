.. parsed-literal::

   fix ID group-ID cac/nve/limit xmax

* ID, group-ID are documented in :doc:`fix <fix>` command
* cac/nve = style name of this fix command]
* xmax = maximum distance a material point can move in one timestep (distance units)

Description
"""""""""""

Perform velocity verlet integration to update position and velocity for
atoms and finite elements in the group each timestep. A limit is imposed on the maximum distance an
atom can move in one timestep.  This is useful when starting a
simulation with an unstable configuration.
Normally this can generate huge forces which would lead to
lost atoms, causing LAMMPS to stop with an error.

Using this fix can overcome that problem.  Forces must still
be computable (which typically means 2 atoms must have a separation
distance > 0.0).  But large velocities generated by large forces are
reset to a value that corresponds to a displacement of length *xmax*
in a single timestep.  *Xmax* is specified in distance units; see the
:doc:`units <units>` command for details.  The value of *xmax* should be
consistent with the neighbor skin distance and the frequency of
neighbor list re-building, so that pairwise interactions are not
missed on successive timesteps as atoms move.  See the
:doc:`neighbor <neighbor>` and :doc:`neigh_modify <neigh_modify>` commands
for details.

**Restart, fix\_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:**

No information about this fix is written to :doc:`binary restart files <restart>`.  None of the :doc:`fix\_modify <fix_modify>` options
are relevant to this fix.  No global or per-atom quantities are stored
by this fix for access by various :doc:`output commands <Howto_output>`.
No parameter of this fix can be used with the *start/stop* keywords of
the :doc:`run <run>` command.  This fix is not invoked during :doc:`energy minimization <minimize>`.
